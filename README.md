# Keto Code Dark Theme

Welcome to the Keto Code Dark Theme! This is a personal side project that I created when I was just starting to learn how to code. I wanted a dark theme with muted colors that would be easy on my eyes during long coding sessions.

After trying out various themes, I decided to take matters into my own hands and learn how to customize the color tokens myself. And that's how this theme came to life!

Please keep in mind that this theme is a work in progress. I will continue updating and refining it until every token is customized to perfection.

If you come across any bugs or errors, please report them via the GitHub Issues. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

Happy coding!
